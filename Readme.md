# Calculator using JavaScript

This project demonstrates the core concepts of JavaScript through the creation of a simple calculator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes functionalities for clearing the input and calculating the result.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simply clone the repository or download the files and open `index.html` in your browser to see the calculator in action.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the calculator.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the calculator.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to make the calculator functional.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file defines the structure of the calculator.

## CSS Styling

The `style.css` file is used to style the calculator. You can customize the appearance of the calculator by modifying this file.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code that makes the calculator functional.


1. Getting the Input Element: The `input` variable is used to reference the display area of the calculator.
2. Selecting All Buttons: The `button` variable selects all the button elements on the calculator.
3. Adding Event Listeners: For each button, an event listener is added to handle the click event.
4. Button Functionality:
   - Clear (C) Button: Clears the display.
   - Backspace (âœ–) Button: Removes the last character from the display.
   - Equals (=) Button: Evaluates the expression displayed and shows the result.
   - Other Buttons: Appends the button text to the display.

### Running the Project

To see the calculator in action, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can then interact with the calculator by clicking the buttons to perform calculations.
